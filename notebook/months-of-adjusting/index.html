Which to be honest still hunts me but I have decided to move forward with it and make StaticPage a real page builder for various theme supporting platforms.</p> <h2 id="time-to-make-money">Time to Make Money</h2> <p>While being paralyzed from the above paragraph and various opinions about what should I do with the damn thing which isn’t less paralyzing. Shifting context to something else hopefully would help me come back to StaticPage with a refresh look and energy.</p> <p>This brought me to apply for “Osek Murshe” (Authorized Dealer) Israeli term for <em>Small Business License</em> for small businesses with yearly revenue above ₪100k. “Why?”, you might ask. Well, it was time for me to get off my ass and start making money! They aren’t growing on trees you know?! I wish they were… Anyhow, the best way I know how to make money besides working a full-time job is freelancing, and to make everything legal I had to get a small business license of some sort.</p> <h2 id="the-website">The Website</h2> <p>Getting “Osek Murshe” was the easier part, getting clients would be the harder part as always is. Clients want to see a portfolio if you are a creative professional. Great, this means I can build myself a website, but first I would sketch it out, to the Sketchmobile! Here is a website sketch that wasn’t picked:</p> <p><img src="/images/notebook/2019-11-04-months-of-adjusting/website-sketch.png" alt="Website Sketch"/> <em>Website sketch that could go pro but never did.</em></p> <p>The design you are reading off right now was the lucky one. If you are reading these lines off an email (I have sent you with a fashioned delay) you are more than welcome to visit the website at <a href="https://idan.goldman.work">idan.goldman.work</a>. Let me know what do you think about the long resume page. ;)</p> <p>I won’t bore you with all the details of what and how the website was built but rather give you a fast bulletin summary:</p> <ul> <li>My goal was to build a “read-only” resume page without visual distractions in an article format and not in the traditional resume template format.</li> <li>Beside the <a href="https://idan.goldman.work">Resume</a> page there are 2 other pages on the website <a href="https://idan.goldman.work/notebook/">Notebook</a> page for my blobs and <a href="https://idan.goldman.work/say_hello/">Say Hello</a> for anyone that want to contact me over email or just feel like staying anonymous.</li> <li>The website was built upon Jekyll static site generator, this tech gave it a good loading speed and Markdown support for easy content writing.</li> <li>The build created 2 new open source projects: <a href="https://github.com/idangoldman/kit">Kit</a> and <a href="https://github.com/idangoldman/rebo">Rebo</a>. You can read all about them at their GitHub pages or in the <a href="https://idan.goldman.work/#products-and-open-source">Products and Open Source</a> section of the resume page.</li> <li>You can view the source code of <a href="https://github.com/idangoldman/idan.goldman.work">idan.goldman.work</a> on GitHub.</li> </ul> <p>There is still work to be done on the website. For example splitting the Resume page into About, Services, and Projects pages. Because it’s really too long of a page to have people read in one sitting while searching for a freelancer or a consultant. And this work will be done in the next iterations of work on the website.</p> <h2 id="workflow-adjustment">Workflow Adjustment</h2> <p>At the beginning of the road if you remember I was writing about blocking websites, tracking time, writing to-dos, setting goals, and of course my beautiful soul wanted to do meditation. Well, this went to shit over time…</p> <p>So, these days I’m trying to readjust but first here are the stuff that did work:</p> <ul> <li>Blocking websites doesn’t work for me, need to find another way to avoid browsing distractions. I’m open to suggestions!</li> <li>Tracking time was the most valuable tool to keep me in the zone of productivity and sadly was the first one I have unlearned.</li> <li>Setting goals felt great but I forgot to check them on a weekly basis and see if I’m in line with them.</li> <li>Writing and checking out to-dos might be the only thing that kept me going and I have actively tried to perfect it.</li> </ul> <p>Here are the adjustments I’m trying to apply:</p> <ul> <li>Going back on track with time tracking half-hour working cycles aren’t enough, I want to increase them to an hour and see if this helps me dive into “the zone” focus mindset.</li> <li>Month by month goals for the next half-year changed into one list of goals. Every last Thursday of the month I’m taking a look at the list and decide the next month’s goals.</li> <li>Every last Thursday of a week (or any other day at the weekend) I’m going over the to-dos and the monthly goals to plan out the week.</li> <li>At the end of each day I’m going through the to-dos I have done that day and plan out for next day’s to-dos.</li> </ul> <p>Meditation and sport aren’t in my routine yet but they must be in the future for now I’m trying to remind myself to stay present in the moment and have a healthy food diet.</p> <p>That is it for this update folks.
