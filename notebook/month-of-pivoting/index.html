<h4 id="hello-how-was-your-month">Hello, how was your month?</h4>


<p>YES! We went on a trip to Portugal for the second time. It was awesome as always! Good food, beaches, weather, alcohol, and one-stop at Starbucks for old times sake. See photos from the trip on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/idan.goldman/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> account.</p>

<p>With recharged energy, I have decided to move out of the apartment into <a href="https://www.wework.com/labs" target="_blank">WeWork Labs</a> and do the product right by pivoting.</p>

<h2 id="pivoting-to-a-different-problem">Pivoting to a Different Problem</h2>

<p>The problem I have been trying to solve with a ‚ÄúComing Soon Page Builder‚Äù product was not a real problem for my target audience because it already has a good enough solution. The product does solve a problem for a different audience that I‚Äôm not interested to pursue and develop a product in that direction.</p>

<p>Now what? Well, redefining the problem, a pivot. Whatever you say when you hit the wall with your product and need to change some stuff to move forward.</p>

<h2 id="market-research">Market Research</h2>

<p>The new problem is ‚Äúdesigners, developers, and webmasters, spend a lot of time on moving the envelope from design to code to a content management system to the server. Also, they spend a lot of time on learning technologies for project X on demand from their clients‚Äù.</p>

<p>This problem led me to the question of ‚Äúhow to create a tool with design and code abilities to help designers, developers, and webmasters save time‚Äù.</p>

<p>Before running to write code while screaming various answers inside my head. I want to solve this problem right by first validating with designers, developers, webmasters that this is an actual problem.</p>

<p>As I write these lines I‚Äôm interviewing people from the target audience to see if the problem and the solution are valid. Interviewing a crowd of 100 people will make me comfortable to decide if I have a valid case to proceed.</p>

<h2 id="current-month">Current Month</h2>

<p>So, this month I will be focusing on only one thing which is market research. Talking to people and see if I can help them solve a problem I think they have.</p>

<p>Wish me luck, fingers crossed!</p>

<h2 id="thanks-for-reading">Thanks for reading!</h2>
