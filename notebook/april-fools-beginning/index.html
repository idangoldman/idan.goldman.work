Turing one of these ideas into a real product will be my main focus in the following months. Also, I will be writing about the journey of taking this product to market.</p> <p>So, what is the product you ask? A product that I have been working on over 3 years (on/off, mostly off) and some of you are probably tired hearing about it.</p> <p><strong>StaticPage</strong> is a page builder made for creating <em>Coming Soon</em> pages with features like a countdown clock, social icons, MailChimp integration. Oh, and the ability to download the page and publish it on any hosting provider you want. I know it‚Äôs not much, but it‚Äôs only the beginning!</p> <p>You can enjoy watching an old demo video of <strong>StaticPage</strong> here:<br/> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKsY3fVeoa0" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKsY3fVeoa0</a></p> <p>The marketing efforts will be focused on <em>Door-to-Door</em> marketing to page building sellers on freelance markets like Fiverr, as Paul Graham famously said: ‚Äú<a href="http://paulgraham.com/ds.html" target="_blank">Do things that Don‚Äôt Scale</a>‚Äù.</p> <h2 id="commitment">Commitment</h2> <p>I will be launching <strong>StaticPage</strong> on <em>May 1st</em>, with all the irony it being the Worker‚Äôs Day and all.</p> <p>What‚Äôs stopping me from going back on the promise to you, delivering <strong>StaticPage</strong> in one month?
