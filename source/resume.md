# Resume

#### TLDR; link to my [LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/idangoldman/){:target="_blank"}.

My name is Idan as you can see from the title of this page. I have been part of the tech industry for over 10 years, mostly focused on Frontend technologies and languages.

HTML, CSS, JS, runs in my blood and I'm up-to-date with the current versions of these languages. Over the years I have worked with Angular, React, Bootstrap, Backbone, jQuery and building my own JavaScript framework and SASS UI Kit (yeah, I'm one of those people), you can check them out on my Github page.

Ruby on Rails, Flask, Express, Laravel are the Backend frameworks I have used over the years and sometimes act as a Full-stacker. That doesn't read well, I'm old enough to prefer to be called a Web Developer. I'm also great at connecting APIs with different data structures, Backend to Frontend, Frontend to 3rd-party services.

On the CMS side, I'm most experienced with Jekyll, WordPress, Shopify. I have built various websites using these platforms, started from the development environment all the way to the production environment. Also, created multiple themes and plugins for these platforms, even got a chance to build a WordPress VIP plugin.

One more thing, I have a feel for UX/UI design. This always helped me communicate better with design and product professionals to make great end products. Adaptive or Responsive design with Parallax scrolling are my jam. I can create a solid design on top of given Mockups or Wireframes using preferable Design System (Material design, Bootstrap, etc).


## Here are projects I can take credit for:

### StaticPage:
Quick and simple Coming Soon pages builder with the ability to download the source code of the page. The app is 100% me, from the design to the backend. The second version is still in the making, talking with people and drawing mockups. To sum it up this evolved version in one sentence "All in one-page builder for various content platforms".

### toDoin:
All developers have their shot at making a to-do list app, this is my variation as a chrome extension.

### Feature:
My JavaScript framework, still in the making, inspired by jQuery and Rails. You can check it out on my GitHub page.

### Kit:
With the help of a friend we have created an awesome UI Kit which is also still in the making. You can check it out on my GitHub page.


## Here are work bulletins I can't take credit* for:

- 2 UI Kits (or design systems).
- Certified WordPress VIP Plugin.
- Various WordPress websites, 2 of them with Multisite support and coherent design done by Parent theme with Child themes adjustments.
- 100+ successful design to code conversions, even before the time of responsive design with the need to support IE6.
- Helped build frontend web apps of all shape on teams of all sizes.
- More boring stuff on my LinkedIn.

*credit - goes to my employer or freelance client.

## Here are work bulletins I can help you with:

- Creating UI Kits from design for development teams.
- Custom made WordPress Themes or Plugins without the use of page builders.
