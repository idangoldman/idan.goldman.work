## Maintenance
`Bug fixing`, `adding features`, `optimizing speed`, in other words, day to day tech maintenance. I can help you with maintaining your `website`, `mobile` or `web application` using various technologies. For example `WordPress`, `Shopify`, `Jekyll`, `Gatsby`, `React`, `Vue`, `Vanilla JavaScript`, `Rails`, `Flask`, `Express`, and `Node`.

## Design to Code

Do you have a design made in `Sketch`/`Figma`/`Adobe XD`/even in good old `Photoshop` for your next `website`/`landing page`/`admin panel`/`web application` and need to make it into a working prototype? Maybe you need to convert the design into a working frontend application receiving business logic from the backend and communicating it back. Either way, I can help you with that, with years of experience converting a design from `Sketch`/`Figma`/`Adobe XD`/`Photoshop` to plain simple code of `HTML`, `CSS`, `JS`. I can convert your design into a theme for `WordPress`, `Shopify`, `Jekyll`, `Gatsby`, or template for `Rails`, `Django`, `Flask`, `Laravel`, or other applications. Have a `React`, `Angular`, `Vue`, or `Ember`, not a problem at all. If you ask nicely, I can make a design system out of your design as well.

## Custom Made

Have an idea for an `application`/`website`/`mobile app`/`chrome extension` but don't know how to code it? I'm your guy for the job! I have the experience and what it takes to code an idea into reality using the latest tech.

## Frontend Staff Support

Need an extra team member on your project and don't have the time to hire a full-time frontend developer? I'm your man for the job! I can quickly understand your project's requirements and architecture and start working with your team asap.

Maybe you need an in-house frontend team but don't know where to begin? I can come in, analyze your needs and recruit an in-house frontend team for you.

## Webmaster Staff Support

Have a `WordPress` website, maybe a `Shopify` store and need someone from time to time make changes to it on a design and code level? Fix a bug, add another product page, update a plugin, make a backup, stuff like that. I can help you with these kind of tasks as I have experience doing so with this kind of content management systems.

## Code Review

Need another set of eyes to look at your code? Maybe you need a piece of advice about the current code architecture? I can help you with that free of charge. My specialty is frontend code, everything to do with `HTML`, `CSS`, `JS`, `React`, `Vue`, `Design systems`, and frontend deployment and development setups with tools like `Gulp` and `Webpack`, `Parcel`.

## Hosting

Do you need a recommendation on a good hosting provider for your `WordPress` or `Jekyll` website? Maybe you need a hosting solution for your `Rails` or `Django` application? I can help you with that by recommending a solution that fits your use case or even set up and maintain a hosting server for you.
