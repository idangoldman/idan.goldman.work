I'm starting a journey as a Bootstrapper and will be launching a product on May 1st.

#### Hello friends, family, and people I met along the way!

**TL;DR** I'm starting a journey as a Bootstrapper and will be launching a product on May 1st.

## Fresh Start
After 10+ years in the tech industry as a FrontEnd/WordPress/BackEnd guy, I have decided to quit my job and follow the dream of creating a remote product company.

Lots of different product ideas floating in my head that I would love to see (and use) in the market today. Turing one of these ideas into a real product will be my main focus in the following months. Also, I will be writing about the journey of taking this product to market.

So, what is the product you ask? A product that I have been working on over 3 years (on/off, mostly off) and some of you are probably tired hearing about it.

**StaticPage** is a page builder made for creating *Coming Soon* pages with features like a countdown clock, social icons, MailChimp integration. Oh, and the ability to download the page and publish it on any hosting provider you want. I know it's not much, but it's only the beginning!

You can enjoy watching an old demo video of **StaticPage** here:\

The marketing efforts will be focused on *Door-to-Door* marketing to page building sellers on freelance markets like Fiverr, as Paul Graham famously said: "[Do things that Don't Scale](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html){:target="_blank"}".


## Commitment
I will be launching **StaticPage** on *May 1st*, with all the irony it being the Worker's Day and all.

What's stopping me from going back on the promise to you, delivering **StaticPage** in one month? A lifetime commitment to you! OK, not a lifetime but a weekly one. Every Monday, an email update will be sent out describing the progress that been made that week. The extremists can get a daily progress update by following me on *Twitter* ([@idan_goldman](https://twitter.com/idan_goldman){:target="_blank"}).
