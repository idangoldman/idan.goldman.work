#### Hello, how was your month?

My month was split into two parts, before vacation and after.

YES! We went on a trip to Portugal for the second time. It was awesome as always! Good food, beaches, weather, alcohol, and one-stop at Starbucks for old times sake. See photos from the trip on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/idan.goldman/){:target="_blank"} account.

With recharged energy, I have decided to move out of the apartment into [WeWork Labs](https://www.wework.com/labs){:target="_blank"} and do the product right by pivoting.

## Pivoting to a Different Problem

The problem I have been trying to solve with a "Coming Soon Page Builder" product was not a real problem for my target audience because it already has a good enough solution. The product does solve a problem for a different audience that I'm not interested to pursue and develop a product in that direction.

Now what? Well, redefining the problem, a pivot. Whatever you say when you hit the wall with your product and need to change some stuff to move forward.

## Market Research

The new problem is "designers, developers, and webmasters, spend a lot of time on moving the envelope from design to code to a content management system to the server. Also, they spend a lot of time on learning technologies for project X on demand from their clients".

This problem led me to the question of "how to create a tool with design and code abilities to help designers, developers, and webmasters save time".

Before running to write code while screaming various answers inside my head. I want to solve this problem right by first validating with designers, developers, webmasters that this is an actual problem.

As I write these lines I'm interviewing people from the target audience to see if the problem and the solution are valid. Interviewing a crowd of 100 people will make me comfortable to decide if I have a valid case to proceed.

## Current Month

So, this month I will be focusing on only one thing which is market research. Talking to people and see if I can help them solve a problem I think they have.

Wish me luck, fingers crossed!
