#### Hello, how were your last two weeks?

Mine went good all things considered except the routine which went to hell. I'm partially back to work! Re-recorded StaticPage's walkthrough video. Published Fiverr gig "Create a Coming Soon Page in 1 Day". Got more traction on Twitter with the help of a pen pal, and got deeper into the rabbit hole of productivity apps.

## Todos Management

As you know, I have left Trello for old school pen and paper. Which are great for short term daily tasks, but get messy after a few days. That is why I'm testing [Todoist](https://todoist.com/){:target="_blank"} and [TickTick](https://ticktick.com/){:target="_blank"} todo lists managers. Each one has its own advantages, for example, TickTick has more features. Like todo description, calendar integration, Pomodoro timer built in. On the other hand, Todoist is much simpler, better known (community support), and has Karma points. Every time you check something off the list Todoist gives you some Karma points which seems meaningless at first but motivating in the long term!

**Bottom line**, I need more time to test and decide which one is best for me.

## Fiverr Gig

Posted yesterday my first gig on Fiverr titled "[Create a Coming Soon Page in 1 Day](https://www.fiverr.com/idan_goldman/create-a-coming-soon-page-in-1-day){:target="_blank"}". The gig is all about creating a Coming Soon page for $20 using StaticPage. In the end, the buyer will get the coming soon page and a StaticPage account to play around with. This week, I will be promoting this gig on LinkedIn and Twitter might help land my first buyer.

**P.S.** I have missed a goal deadline on this one by a week and two marketplaces. The goal was on "May 13th, Official release of Fiverr, Upwork, PeoplePerHour seller accounts".

## Social Media
I'm getting more traction on Twitter by sharing my experience and knowledge as a developer with beginner developers. I'm trying to help them overcome their fear of code, not knowing everything by memory, and actual code problems. This wouldn't have been possible without my pen pal [@YuriSpiridonov](https://twitter.com/YuriSpiridonov){:target="_blank"} who shares a lot of my tweets with his followers. Next, I will try to do the same on LinkedIn.

## Current week

This week I will be focusing on the following things:

- **Promoting my Fiverr gig** on social media channels until I will get the first buyer.
- **Leaning more about what works** on social media in terms of engagement and traffic. Focusing on Twitter and LinkedIn only.
- **Continue working on the walkthrough video** "How to: Create a Coming Soon page with StaticPage". Hopefully will be done with it by next week.
