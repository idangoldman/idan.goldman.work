Mine went great, deployed the new landing page on time, talked with some of you, got great advice, and even worked a bit on the upcoming video. Then I had to go through a small medical procedure that took me "out of order" for the rest of the week and from the looks of it this week too.

#### Hello, how was your week?

Mine went great, deployed the new landing page on time, talked with some of you, got great advice, and even worked a bit on the upcoming video. Then I had to go through a small medical procedure that took me "out of order" for the rest of the week and from the looks of it this week too.

Now, I'm following the doctor's orders: staying in bed, walking around the house, and eating well. Which makes me crazy but hey! I want to get better fast and go back to doing what I'm doing.. creating a great product company!

*Until next week or month*, enjoy and let me know what you think! ðŸ™Œ
