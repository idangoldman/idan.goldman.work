We went on a trip to Portugal for the second time. It was awesome as always! Good food, beaches, weather, alcohol, and one-stop at Starbucks for old times sake. See photos from the trip on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/idan.goldman/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; account.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With recharged energy, I have decided to move out of the apartment into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wework.com/labs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WeWork Labs&lt;/a&gt; and do the product right by pivoting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;pivoting-to-a-different-problem&quot;&gt;Pivoting to a Different Problem&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The problem I have been trying to solve with a ‚ÄúComing Soon Page Builder‚Äù product was not a real problem for my target audience because it already has a good enough solution. The product does solve a problem for a different audience that I‚Äôm not interested to pursue and develop a product in that direction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now what? Well, redefining the problem, a pivot. Whatever you say when you hit the wall with your product and need to change some stuff to move forward.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;market-research&quot;&gt;Market Research&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new problem is ‚Äúdesigners, developers, and webmasters, spend a lot of time on moving the envelope from design to code to a content management system to the server. Also, they spend a lot of time on learning technologies for project X on demand from their clients‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This problem led me to the question of ‚Äúhow to create a tool with design and code abilities to help designers, developers, and webmasters save time‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before running to write code while screaming various answers inside my head. I want to solve this problem right by first validating with designers, developers, webmasters that this is an actual problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I write these lines I‚Äôm interviewing people from the target audience to see if the problem and the solution are valid. Interviewing a crowd of 100 people will make me comfortable to decide if I have a valid case to proceed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;current-month&quot;&gt;Current Month&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, this month I will be focusing on only one thing which is market research. Talking to people and see if I can help them solve a problem I think they have.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wish me luck, fingers crossed!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;thanks-for-reading&quot;&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The newsletter sent to 119 people on Monday before last and until today it achieved:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;46 (39%) opened.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;2 (4.3%) replied.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;1 (0.84%) unsubscribed.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Until next month&lt;/em&gt;, enjoy and let me know what you think! üôå&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>idan_goldman</name></author><category term="newsletter"/><summary type="html">My month was split into two parts, before vacation and after.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Month of Flying By</title><link href="https://idan.goldman.work/notebook/month-of-flying-by/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Month of Flying By"/><published>2019-07-01T18:06:00+03:00</published><updated>2019-10-16T01:24:09+03:00</updated><id>https://idan.goldman.work/notebook/month-of-flying-by</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://idan.goldman.work/notebook/month-of-flying-by/">&lt;p&gt;It was a good and relaxing month for me, the ‚Äúindependence‚Äù part starting to sink in. Making me shift focus from doing only things that will bring immediate value to things that need more time to harvest. For example: meeting people, creating new connections, maintaining early ones too instead of building a web agency.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- more --&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;hello-how-was-your-month&quot;&gt;Hello, how was your month?&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was a good and relaxing month for me, the ‚Äúindependence‚Äù part starting to sink in. Making me shift focus from doing only things that will bring immediate value to things that need more time to harvest. For example: meeting people, creating new connections, maintaining early ones too instead of building a web agency.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This brings my next point, I have met a few interesting people this month and had the pleasure to be interviewed at &lt;a href=&quot;https://indietlv.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;IndieTLV&lt;/a&gt;‚Äôs Hack Night. This event happens every 2 weeks at the Google Campus in Tel Aviv, you should check it out! Oh, and you can watch the interview &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMhQtl4VHv4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (in Hebrew).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last thing, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://staticpage.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new website&lt;/a&gt; is up and running.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;launch-and-forget&quot;&gt;Launch and Forget&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Israel, we use this idiom to describe automation. Create something of value (what does that even mean?), release it to the internet (what could possibly go wrong?), and interact with it only in the time of need (meaning never).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This what I was trying to achieve with automating my social media presence. 4 posts a week during work days on 2 social networks (Twitter, LinkedIn). 4 weeks in, I have achieved great success in the automation department only 30min of work every two weeks! BUT the engagement department suffered deeply with decreasing numbers. My guess, it‚Äôs because I have stopped engaging with others on those social networks. Also, most of the content created from socializing on those networks and now it‚Äôs almost gone!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A guess, I will be going back to engaging on social media‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;college-experience&quot;&gt;College Experience&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was hard for me to focus this month and do the work. Instead, I was more focused on household chores during work hours. I got pretty good at laundry, dishwashing, organizing, and taking the garbage out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;None of those helped to move the product forward‚Ä¶ So, I have decided to search for a ‚Äúhot desk‚Äù in one of Tel Aviv‚Äôs workspaces. This will help place home/work boundaries and more importantly make me part of a community. A real one, where you need to interact with words and smiles, kind of college experience I never had.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;freelance-aint-free&quot;&gt;Freelance ain‚Äôt Free&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm shutting down the whole Freelance Markets expedition until further notice. Fiverr REALLY not working for me and UpWork have a demand and supply volume which requires full-time attention. I prefer to spend that attention on making the next version of StaticPage based on users and friends feedback.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;current-month&quot;&gt;Current Month&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, this month I will be focusing on the following things:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving to a workspace&lt;/strong&gt;, meeting new people, networking and hearing out other people thoughts on StaticPage and the market.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing the specs&lt;/strong&gt; of the next version of StaticPage. Damn It‚Äôs going to be awesome!&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding freelancers&lt;/strong&gt; to help me build the next version of StaticPage.

Tried to share the gig on my social media accounts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6539187166130561024/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/idan_goldman/status/1133443320162791424&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; as recommended by Fiverr and nothing changed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;During the next 2 weeks&lt;/strong&gt;, I will be selling proactively on Fiverr. There is a ‚ÄúBuyer Requests‚Äù page on the site, where buyers can post their gig requests and Sellers can apply. Already applied for a ‚Äúbuild static web page‚Äù gig.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if this won‚Äôt work?&lt;/strong&gt; I‚Äôm off Fiverr to open UpWork or PeoplePerHour (Freelance markets like Fiverr) account and continue with the proactive approach. Applying for job offers to ‚Äúbuild static web pages‚Äù of all sorts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm using this technique for two reasons. First to understand better the needs and trends of the buying crowd. Second to understand the sellers‚Äô crowd needs firsthand and what kind of tools will help them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-content&quot;&gt;Creating Content&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Damn it‚Äôs hard! Writing is awesome but time-consuming and a real skill I hopefully will craft one day. But this is not what I wanted to talk to you about in this section. I had a Goal of publishing my first blog post by &lt;strong&gt;1st of June&lt;/strong&gt; and everything went according to plan &lt;strong&gt;UNTIL&lt;/strong&gt; I had a new plan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The New Plan&lt;/strong&gt;, separate the website code from the application code and move the website code to the same one the blog is using. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, the codebase the blog is using if you were wondering.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This change taking more time than expected but it‚Äôs a positive one. Combining the website and the blog under the same roof (content management system) is a good thing for search engine optimization, content editing, design editing, code writing, and especially for new sections like documentation and support (more about those in the next Newsletter üòâ).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;social-media-updates&quot;&gt;Social Media Updates&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This was a good social media month! Twitter numbers got +100% increase and I‚Äôm excited to grow the account even further this month. Also, I have tried sharing content on LinkedIn starting last week and still don‚Äôt know what to make of it. I even opened my first business social account on Instagram. It‚Äôs the perfect platform to create a community around a visual product like StaticPage. Waiting until next week to create and publish content on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All this social media activity wasn‚Äôt possible without automating the process of sharing on social networks. I‚Äôm sharing 1-2 posts a day, 4 days a week (Mon-Thu) on Twitter and LinkedIn. This would take me hours every day if I would do it by hand! Thankfully, there are ways to automate this! One of the ways is to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://buffer.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Buffer&lt;/a&gt; (social media management platform).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;current-month&quot;&gt;Current Month&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have decided to move the newsletter update for a monthly one. The biggest reason for the change is: it‚Äôs hard for me to write fast and it‚Äôs taking me half a day to a day to make the newsletter. Moving it to once a month task will clear time to do other tasks and make the content of the newsletter better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, this month I will be focusing on the following things:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Releasing the blog&lt;/strong&gt; by finishing building it and writing the first blog post. Have any idea what the first blog post should be about? Let me know!&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applying daily for Buyer Requests&lt;/strong&gt; on Fiverr to get my first gig.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opening UpWork or PeoplePerHour account&lt;/strong&gt; and applying to job offerings to build static web pages.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social media growth&lt;/strong&gt; by generating and posting more content onto it. Also, talk to people on Social networks about StaticPage and hear their feedback.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;thanks-for-reading&quot;&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The newsletter sent to 122 people on last Monday and until today it achieved:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;48 (39.7%) opened.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;4 (8.3%) replied.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;4 (8.3%) clicked on links.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;0 subscribed.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;1 (0.8%) unsubscribed.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Until next week&lt;/em&gt;, enjoy and let me know what you think! üôå&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>idan_goldman</name></author><category term="newsletter"/><summary type="html">Mine went awesome!

Each one has its own advantages, for example, TickTick has more features. Like todo description, calendar integration, Pomodoro timer built in. On the other hand, Todoist is much simpler, better known (community support), and has Karma points. Every time you check something off the list Todoist gives you some Karma points which seems meaningless at first but motivating in the long term!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;, I need more time to test and decide which one is best for me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;fiverr-gig&quot;&gt;Fiverr Gig&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Posted yesterday my first gig on Fiverr titled ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fiverr.com/idan_goldman/create-a-coming-soon-page-in-1-day&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Create a Coming Soon Page in 1 Day&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù.

Not including talking to potential users, researching competitors, and talking with friends that help me with web design and video editing.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I have &lt;strong&gt;meditated 4 out of 7 days&lt;/strong&gt; this week.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positive&lt;/strong&gt;, the stats are good for a first week especially with holidays and all. This Pomodoro technique¬Æ and blocked websites gave me a framework to work in and focus! Also, I‚Äôm starting to get a sense of how much time I‚Äôm spending on each task. Can see how it will benefit me in the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negative&lt;/strong&gt;, A bit bummed out about the meditation, might be the holidays, might be just me struggling with it. But I‚Äôm not worried about it at the moment. Also, stopped using &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt; for task management, back to using pen and paper. Crossing items off the list manually.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;may-1st-release&quot;&gt;May 1st Release&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The work on a new landing page for StaticPage is done with the help of a friend which is a brilliant web and product designer. The work on the new video for the landing page continues with the help of a skillful artistic friend. Don‚Äôt worry the video won‚Äôt have any 3D effects. We are trying to make it as professional as possible and it takes time, that is why it might not be ready for the May 1st release. With that written the new landing page will be launched on time! Worst case scenario the video will be replaced couple of days later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;current-week&quot;&gt;Current week&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This week I will be focusing on the following things:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing a product release&lt;/strong&gt; part of May 1st release to StaticPage users and mailing list members announcing new landing page, video, and templates feature.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start working on marketing&lt;/strong&gt; myself as an expert building landing pages or coming soon pages on Fiverr. Trying to land my first gig and do it with the help of StaticPage.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;thanks-for-reading&quot;&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The newsletter sent to 129 people on last Monday and until today it achieved:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;51 (40.5%) opened.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;6 (11.7%) replied, 2 of them ‚Äúon - vacation‚Äù auto-replies. :D&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;3 (5.8%) clicked on links.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;1 (0.8%) subscribed.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;5 (3.8%) unsubscribed.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Waiting to see next week‚Äôs numbers!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;following-me-and-the-landing-page-competition&quot;&gt;Following me and the landing page competition?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yeah, I‚Äôm not going to win.

Released a StaticPage templates feature and instead of continuing to build a new landing page. I took a step back and thought about my near future goals and working routine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- more --&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;hello-how-was-your-week&quot;&gt;Hello, how was your week?&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;My week went solid. Released a StaticPage templates feature and instead of continuing to build a new landing page. I took a step back and thought about my near future goals and working routine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;work-routine&quot;&gt;Work Routine&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I had to change some stuff in my work routine. Working long hours in chaos might be cool at the moment but won‚Äôt help me in the long run. Especially when new and old media distractions are a click away. A cup of tea in my right hand and phone in my left, I have decided to make some changes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First thing first&lt;/strong&gt;, for any good routine to work it has to start with an information diet. NO social networks, NO news sites, NO entertainment or game sites during work hours. &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/site-blocker/ccachieepekabdbcpfegamckdidpepga&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Site blocker&lt;/a&gt; is a chrome extension helping me with the task of blocking distracting sites. The count of blocked sites stands on 15 at the moment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second thing&lt;/strong&gt;, for any good routine to work it has to have a pace. What better to measure time and give pace than &lt;a href=&quot;https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pomodoro Technique¬Æ&lt;/a&gt;. I will be doing 12 pomodoros of 30 minutes each a day with optional breaks of 5 or 15 minutes in between. &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/marinara-pomodoro%C2%AE-assist/lojgmehidjdhhbmpjfamhpkpodfcodef&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Marinara: Pomodoro¬Æ Assistant&lt;/a&gt; is a chrome extension helping me with the task of work pacing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third thing&lt;/strong&gt;, for any routine to work the mind has to be in favor of it. How can I train the brain to be on my side? Meditation comes to mind. I have tried it once before and it did wonders for me. I will do it once a day, every morning for 10 minutes. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.headspace.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Headspace&lt;/a&gt; is a mindfulness phone app helping me with the task of thoughts balance and peace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can feel you screaming at me, SPORTS!!! You should do sports! Yeah, I know, I should and I will. As better people before me said: ‚Äúone step at the time‚Äù. First, I will learn how to do this routine and then I will add more complex actions to it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs not easy, I can tell you that! But it‚Äôs worth it. I will update you on the progress with some stats next week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;near-future-goals&quot;&gt;Near future goals&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Part of the chaos surrounding me was not having clear goals for the near future. Besides the one at the end of the month and keeping you updated. At which, I‚Äôm doing a pretty consistent job! But, I do need more goals at least for the next couple of months to keep moving forward. So, I did a little soul digging and come up with a few goals that will promote StaticPage as a product and me as a creator and a provider. Here they are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 1st&lt;/strong&gt;, Launch a StaticPage landing page with services provided and a walkthrough video.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 13th&lt;/strong&gt;, Have an active seller account on these freelance markets: Fiverr, Upwork, PeoplePerHour.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 1st&lt;/strong&gt;, Write a first blog post in a while with that expand StaticPage‚Äôs and my audience.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 20th&lt;/strong&gt;, Get 20 users for StaticPage.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 1st&lt;/strong&gt;, Build a paywall for StaticPage with the ability to try before you buy.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 1st&lt;/strong&gt;, New version of StaticPage on top of user feedback.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 8st&lt;/strong&gt;, StaticPage press release on tech release websites&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;What do you think? Am I going in the right direction?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;current-week&quot;&gt;Current week&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This week I will be focusing on the following things:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a better landing page&lt;/strong&gt; for StaticPage instead of the one I‚Äôm using for the competition. &lt;strong&gt;Create a better walkthrough video&lt;/strong&gt; for StaticPage, including how to create of a landing page, preset templates, and hip background music.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;thanks-for-reading&quot;&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The newsletter sent to 134 people on last Monday and until today it achieved:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;65 (49.2%) opened.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;2 (3%) replied.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;1 (0.8%) clicked on links.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;0 (0%) subscribed to the landing page.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;5 (3.7%) unsubscribed.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Waiting to see next week‚Äôs numbers!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;still-reading-and-want-to-support-me&quot;&gt;Still reading and want to support me?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Please subscribe to StaticPage testing mailing list here: &lt;del&gt;bit.ly/GetStaticPage&lt;/del&gt; and help win $5k which will help growing StaticPage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Until next week&lt;/em&gt;, enjoy and let me know what you think! üôå&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>idan_goldman</name></author><category term="newsletter"/><summary type="html">My week went solid.

I‚Äôm doing two things, here they are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First thing&lt;/strong&gt;, Making *landing pages for a living. If you need a landing page built, let me know I‚Äôm your guy!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second thing&lt;/strong&gt;, building a product named &lt;strong&gt;StaticPage&lt;/strong&gt;. A landing page builder like Wix but better! How better? It takes fewer steps to create a landing page with it. You can download the code and host the landing page wherever you want. Another advantage, you get support from me as quickly as humanly possible and not from a corporate middle man.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;*Landing page is a web page that a business owner wants to drive people to. This web page can be: new website opening, sale for a holiday, product release, etc‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;thanks-for-reading&quot;&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs continue with the most important subject, your numbers. The newsletter sent to 140 people on last Monday and until today it achieved:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;63 (46.7%) opened.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;4 (6.3%) replied.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;3 (2.2%) clicked on links.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;3 (100%) subscribed to the landing page.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;6 (4.2%) unsubscribed.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Interesting to see what‚Äôs the numbers will be this week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;failed-marketing-assumptions&quot;&gt;Failed marketing assumptions&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before starting StaticPage marketing, when someone would ask me about ‚Äúhow would I market StaticPage to the right audience?‚Äù. I would brag that it‚Äôs simple. My audience is freelancers. So, I just need to sign up to the freelance marketplaces and send them a message. They will love StaticPage!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boy, I was wrong&lt;/strong&gt;. I have signed up to 3 freelance marketplaces and not only my messages weren‚Äôt appealing as much as I thought. Also, I have violated the Terms of Service on all the marketplaces and was blocked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the moment I‚Äôm trying to think of alternative ways reaching those freelancers. Facebook groups and Twitter came to mind. Do you have any other suggestions?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;preview-of-staticpage-templates&quot;&gt;Preview of StaticPage templates&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Failing marketing gave me the energy to work on StaticPage‚Äôs code! I‚Äôm proud to release this week a templates feature. Meaning, every time you create a new landing page with StaticPage. You will be able to pick 1 of 4 cool templates to begin with:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/notebook/2019-04-15-feedback-week/back-to-school.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Back to School Template Screenshot&quot; /&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back to School&lt;/strong&gt; template with a Countdown clock.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/notebook/2019-04-15-feedback-week/localbar.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;LocalBar Template Screenshot&quot; /&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LocalBar&lt;/strong&gt; template with Social Icons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/notebook/2019-04-15-feedback-week/goooal.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Gooal Template Screenshot&quot; /&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GOOOAL!&lt;/strong&gt; template with a Mailing list.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/notebook/2019-04-15-feedback-week/flight-club.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Flight Club Template Screenshot&quot; /&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flight Club&lt;/strong&gt; template with a Countdown clock, Mailing list, and Social Icons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;current-week&quot;&gt;Current week&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This week is all about focusing on these things:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Releasing StaticPage‚Äôs templates feature.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Working on a landing page that will explain better what StaticPage is and what I do.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;still-reading-and-want-to-support-me&quot;&gt;Still reading and want to support me?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Please subscribe to StaticPage testing mailing list here: &lt;del&gt;bit.ly/GetStaticPage&lt;/del&gt; and help win $5k which will help growing StaticPage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Until next week&lt;/em&gt;, enjoy and let me know what you think! üôå&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>idan_goldman</name></author><category term="newsletter"/><summary type="html">My week went horribly with the wrong marketing assumptions, followed by anxiety.

I was ready to talk to some potential beta testing customers or sellers as Fiverr calls them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The measurement&lt;/strong&gt; used for finding these sellers was:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;Should have ‚ÄúI Will create a Coming Soon page for you‚Äù gig with above 10 recommendations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The pitch flow&lt;/em&gt; was to approach 50 Fiverr sellers with a cold message, if they respond positively, then send them a link to the landing page. From there, they should decide to subscribe or not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Have sent 3 cold messages before realizing the pitch flow was broken but more on this later. Fixed the pitch flow and successfully sent another 27 cold messages before Fiverr stopped me. They sent a parental notice that I‚Äôm in violation of their terms of use agreement and I should stop immediately. Made sense, so, I did.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anyhow&lt;/strong&gt;, enough with the chit-chat, here are the pitching to sellers stats:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;30 messages were sent.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;23 (79.3%) were interested and got the link to the landing page.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;2 (8.6%) subscribed to the mailing list.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;2 (100%) register to test StaticPage.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Demographic split: Bangladesh (10), Pakistan (7), India (5), Sri Lanka (3), Serbia (2), Kuwait (1), Malaysia (1), US (1).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;1 Bug fixed.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-conclusions&quot;&gt;My conclusions:&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The landing page should be optimized.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Most of the Coming Soon page sellers on Fiverr live in Eastern countries. I will have to overcome cultural and language barriers for me to successfully market to them.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;the-broken-pitch-flow&quot;&gt;The Broken Pitch Flow&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have started cold messaging sellers without a plan on what to respond to an interested seller, who knew they would?! For the first 3 interested sellers, I responded with 2 links. One to the landing page and the second to &lt;strong&gt;StaticPage&lt;/strong&gt; registration page. Realizing that having multiple links is a mistake and I should be sending only one link instead was an AH-HA moment of hindsight thinking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have quickly (took me the rest of the day) started changing the landing page content and flow. In a way that after subscribing to the mailing list, the seller will get an email with the link to register as a beta tester on StaticPage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;*The visual and system bugs with the mailing list software (but hey I‚Äôm in a contest for $5k) did not help and only delayed the continuing of cold messaging Fiverr sellers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;current-week&quot;&gt;Current week&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This week is all about focusing on these things:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Send old StaticPage users an email about the revival of the product.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Approaching freelancers in the market of PeoplePerHour.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Deploy a Templates feature.

Turing one of these ideas into a real product will be my main focus in the following months. Also, I will be writing about the journey of taking this product to market.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, what is the product you ask? A product that I have been working on over 3 years (on/off, mostly off) and some of you are probably tired hearing about it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;StaticPage&lt;/strong&gt; is a page builder made for creating &lt;em&gt;Coming Soon&lt;/em&gt; pages with features like a countdown clock, social icons, MailChimp integration. Oh, and the ability to download the page and publish it on any hosting provider you want. I know it‚Äôs not much, but it‚Äôs only the beginning!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can enjoy watching an old demo video of &lt;strong&gt;StaticPage&lt;/strong&gt; here:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKsY3fVeoa0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKsY3fVeoa0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The marketing efforts will be focused on &lt;em&gt;Door-to-Door&lt;/em&gt; marketing to page building sellers on freelance markets like Fiverr, as Paul Graham famously said: ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/ds.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Do things that Don‚Äôt Scale&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;commitment&quot;&gt;Commitment&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I will be launching &lt;strong&gt;StaticPage&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;em&gt;May 1st&lt;/em&gt;, with all the irony it being the Worker‚Äôs Day and all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What‚Äôs stopping me from going back on the promise to you, delivering &lt;strong&gt;StaticPage&lt;/strong&gt; in one month?
